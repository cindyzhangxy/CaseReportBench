## üìò Overview

**CaseReportBench** is the first benchmark designed for **dense information extraction** from clinical case reports, focused on **rare diseases**, especially **Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEMs)**. This benchmark evaluates how well **large language models (LLMs)** can extract structured, clinically relevant data across **14 system-level categories**, such as Neurology, History, Lab/Imaging, and Musculoskeletal (MSK).

**Key Contributions:**
- A curated dataset of **138 expert-annotated case reports**.
- Dense extractions across 14 predefined diagnostic categories.
- Evaluation of LLMs including **Qwen2*, **Qwen2.5**, **LLaMA3**, and **GPT-4o**.
- Novel prompting strategies: **Filtered Category-Specific Prompting (FCSP)**, **Uniform Category-Specific Prompting (UCP)**, and **Unified Global Prompting (UGP)**.
- Expert clinical assessment of model outputs.

## üß© Source Code Overview (`src/`)

The `src/` folder contains all key components for dataset construction, prompting logic, and LLM evaluation:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `dataset_construction/` | Scripts to process PMC-OA case reports, filter IEM cases, and structure data into prompt-ready JSON. Includes code for expert annotation merging and TSR filtering. |
| `prompting/` | Code to run LLMs (local or API) using structured prompts (UGP, FCSP, UCP), including category-specific and unified templates. Also supports prompt instantiation and model input formatting. |
| `benchmarking_llms/` | Evaluate LLM dense information extractions against gold expert-crafted annotations, and compute all metrics (TSR, EM, hallucination, etc). |

## üß™ Setup Instructions

To set up the environment using Conda:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate CaseReportBench
```
